# Step-by-Step Breakdown of the HTML File

## 1. Setting Up the HTML Structure

First, create your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`). This file will define the structure and content of your webpage.

### HTML Boilerplate
Start with the basic HTML5 boilerplate to set up the foundation of your document:

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Display Types Showcase</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
\`\`\`

### Explanation:
- \`<!DOCTYPE html>\` declares the document as an HTML5 document.
- \`<html lang="en">\` specifies the language of the document as English.
- The \`<head>\` section includes metadata such as character encoding (\`<meta charset="UTF-8">\`) and the viewport settings for responsiveness (\`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\`).
- The \`<title>\` tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- The \`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">\` tag links the external CSS file to style the HTML content.

## 2. Adding Content to the Body

Next, add content inside the \`<body>\` tag. This is where the visual elements of your webpage are defined.

\`\`\`html
<body>
  <h1 class="page-title">CSS Display Types Showcase</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card block-card">
      <p>I am a <strong>block</strong> element. I take up less width but still start on a new line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-container">
      <span class="card inline-card">I am an <strong>inline</strong> element.</span>
      <span class="card inline-card">Another <strong>inline</strong> element.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-block-container">
      <div class="card inline-block-card">I am an <strong>inline-block</strong> element. I respect width and height properties.</div>
      <div class="card inline-block-card">Another <strong>inline-block</strong> element beside me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
\`\`\`

### Explanation:
- \`<body>\` contains the content of the webpage.
- \`<h1 class="page-title">\` is the main heading of the page. The class \`page-title\` can be used to style the heading in CSS.
- \`<div class="container">\` groups the content and helps with layout styling.
- \`<div class="card block-card">\` represents a block element with a specific class \`block-card\`.
- \`<span class="card inline-card">\` represents inline elements with the class \`inline-card\`.
- \`<div class="inline-block-container">\` groups inline-block elements, allowing them to be styled and aligned together.
- \`<div class="card inline-block-card">\` represents inline-block elements with the class \`inline-block-card\`.

## 3. Adding the Footer

Finally, add a footer to summarize the differences between block, inline, and inline-block elements.

\`\`\`html
<footer class="footer">
  <p class="footer-title">Summary of Differences:</p>
  <p><strong>Block:</strong> Takes up the full width of its container and forces a line break after it. Itâ€™s great for structuring larger sections of a webpage. Examples: div, p, section.</p>
  <p><strong>Inline:</strong> Takes up only as much space as its content needs and does not cause a line break. Unlike block elements, you cannot set the width or height of inline elements; they are sized strictly by their content. This makes them ideal for small pieces of content within a line of text, but limits control over their dimensions. Examples: span, a, em.</p>
  <p><strong>Inline-Block:</strong> Sits in line with other content like an inline element but allows you to set its width and height like a block element. This means you can control its size, making it useful for elements that need to be aligned in a row while still having defined dimensions. Examples: img, button, input.</p>
</footer>
\`\`\`

### Explanation:
- \`<footer>\` contains the footer content, typically placed at the bottom of the webpage.
- \`<p class="footer-title">\` is the title of the footer content, which can be styled separately.
- Each \`<p>\` tag provides a summary of the different display types, including examples of HTML elements that use these display properties.

## 4. Closing the HTML Structure

Finally, close your HTML structure with the \`</body>\` and \`</html>\` tags.

\`\`\`html
</body>
</html>
\`\`\`

### Explanation:
- \`</body>\` closes the body section of the document.
- \`</html>\` closes the HTML document.
