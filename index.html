  <p class="footer-title">Summary of Differences:</p>
  <p><strong>Block:</strong> Takes up the full width of its container and forces a line break after it. Itâ€™s great for structuring larger sections of a webpage. Examples: div, p, section.</p>
  <p><strong>Inline:</strong> Takes up only as much space as its content needs and does not cause a line break. Unlike block elements, you cannot set the width or height of inline elements; they are sized strictly by their content. This makes them ideal for small pieces of content within a line of text, but limits control over their dimensions. Examples: span, a, em.</p>
  <p><strong>Inline-Block:</strong> Sits in line with other content like an inline element but allows you to set its width and height like a block element. This means you can control its size, making it useful for elements that need to be aligned in a row while still having defined dimensions. Examples: img, button, input.</p>
